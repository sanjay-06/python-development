# Notes:

# s.path.expanduser('~') :

# os.path.expanduser() method in Python is used to expand an initial path component ~( tilde symbol) o
# r ~user in the given path to user’s home directory.

# On Unix platforms, an initial ~ is replaced by the value of HOME environment variable,
# if it is set. Otherwise, os.path.expanduser() method search for user’s home directory i
# n password directory using an in-built module pwd. Path containing an initial ~user
# component is looked up directly in the password directory.

# On Windows platform, an initial ~ is replaced by the value of HOME and
# USERPROFILE environment variable, if it is set. Otherwise, HOMEPATH and
# HOMEDRIVE environment variable will be used. While Path containing an
# initial ~user component is handled by replacing the last directory component with ~user from the path derived above.
