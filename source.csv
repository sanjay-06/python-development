Gentlemen learned in the law are occasionally money-making men.  One of these was John Campden Neild, M.A., barrister-at-law.  He was the son of a wealthy gold and silversmith in St. James’s Street, and who bequeathed a large property to his miserly son, which he, in turn, considerably enlarged, and bequeathed to her Majesty.  It appeared that, since his father’s death in 1814, he had allowed his money to accumulate, and had scarcely allowed himself the common necessaries of life.  He usually dressed in a blue coat with metal buttons, which he prohibited being brushed, as it would take off the nap and deteriorate its value.  He was never known to wear a great-coat; he was always happy to receive an invitation from his tenantry in Kent and Berks to visit them, which he occasionally did, often remaining a month at a time, as he was thus enabled to add to his savings.  p. 13His appearance and manners led people to imagine that he was in the lowest state of poverty.  Just before the introduction of the railway system of travelling, he had been on a visit to some of his estates, and was returning to London, when the coach stopped at Farningham.  With the exception of our miser, the passengers all entered the inn.  Missing their companion, and recollecting his decayed appearance, they conceived he was in distressed circumstances, and, accordingly, a sum was subscribed for the purchase of a thumping glass of brandy and water for the benefit of the poor gentleman, which he thankfully accepted.  Many instances of a similar character may be related.

Alderman Harmer was the son of a Spitalfields weaver, and was left to work his way as an orphan at the age of ten.  Alderman Wire was the son of a baker at Colchester.  Alderman Kelly, who died in his 80th year, was the architect of his own fortune.  He was originally an assistant in the employ of Mr. John Cooke, of Paternoster Row.  The business chiefly consisted in publishing works in numbers, which were sold up and down the country by means of book-hawkers.  Mr. Kelly succeeded to this business, and so won fame and fortune.  In 1836 he was Lord Mayor of London.  Thomas Cubitt, the well-known builder, born near Norwich in 1788, at an early period in life was thrown upon his own resources, and soon learned to trust in them.  At the death of his father, when he was in his nineteenth year, he was working as a journeyman carpenter.  He shortly afterwards, with a view to improve his circumstances, took a voyage to India and back as captain’s joiner.  On his return to London, then about 21 years of age, with the savings he had put by, he commenced a small business in London as carpenter.  After about six years, appearances of success manifesting themselves, he took a piece of ground from Lord Calthorpe in the Gray’s Inn Road, upon which he erected large buildings and carried on a very large business, which business he handed over to his brother, Mr. Alderman Cubitt, while he built what is known as Belgravia, and, when he died, had accumulated property to the amount of a million sterling.  He was a man of most estimable qualities, clear-headed, energetic, of unswerving integrity, kind to his family, generous and considerate to his workpeople and dependents.

But there are money-making men who are better than p. 14mere money-grubs.  Mr. Gompertz, born in London in 1799, the son of a Dutch diamond merchant, was a self-taught mathematician of very high attainments, who had distinguished himself early in life by the publication of new logarithms.  At the age of thirty, having married Miss Abigail Montefiore, sister of Sir Moses Montefiore, Mr. Gompertz entered his name as a member of the Stock Exchange, doing a large amount of business, but without relinquishing his mathematical pursuits, which gradually turned to tables connected with life insurance.  After working out a new series of tables of mortality, the subject took such a hold of his mind that he decided to quit the Stock Exchange and to devote himself entirely to actuarial science.  Appointed actuary of the Alliance Company under its deed of settlement, he became, both in virtue of his position and through his high connections, its chief manager, doing his work to the satisfaction of the directors.  Mr. Benjamin Gompertz, however, aimed to be nothing more than a man of science; his ambition being to make the best actuarial investigations, and not to do the largest amount of business.  Another illustration we have of this higher life is afforded in the case of Mr. Grote.  Mr. Samuel Rogers may also be quoted as another illustration.  It is well to feel that, after all, there is something better than money-making—that man does not live by bread alone.
